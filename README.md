# Introduction

I'm a Microsoft MVP for Office Apps and Services. I focus primarily on Microsoft Exchange Server or Exchange Online, together with Azure Active Directory, Teams or other related Microsoft 365 related workloads in Microsoft 365. I have a big PowerShell affection as well, and love to create tools and automate processes. You can reach out to me with questions or comments on code or blogs, but also if you are looking for someone for authoring or speaking engagements.

You can contact me via the contact form at https://eightwone.com/contact.
