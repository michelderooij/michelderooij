I'm a Microsoft MVP for Office Apps and Services. I specialize on Exchange Server in conjunction with Azure Active Directory, Teams and Microsoft 365. I have a big PowerShell affection as well and love to create tools and processes to automate.

I blog on [eightwone.com](https://eightwone.com/), and you can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mderooij/).
