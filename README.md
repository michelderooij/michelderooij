I'm a Microsoft MVP for Office Apps and Services. I focus primarily on Microsoft Exchange Server or Exchange Online, together with Azure Active Directory, Teams or other related Microsoft 365 related workloads in Microsoft 365. I have a big PowerShell affection as well, and love to create tools and automate processes.
