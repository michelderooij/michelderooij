## Introduction
Hello there. I'm a Microsoft MVP for Microsoft 365 Apps and Services. I focus primarily on Microsoft Exchange Server and Exchange Online, 
in combination with Identity (Entra) and other related workloads. I have a big PowerShell affection and love to create supporting tools
and automate processes for admins as well as fellow consultants and architects, most of which you can find on my GitHub.
I blog on <a href="https://eightwone.com">eightwone.com</a> and am a published author of 3 <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9591-5">Exchange themed books</a>.
